# Different Types of Knapsack Problems And Their Comparative Analysis Through Different Algorithmic Approaches

This study presents a comparative study of different knapsack problem variants and algorithmic strategies, focusing on 0/1, fractional, and bounded knapsack problems in the context of combinatorial optimization. The project investigates brute force, greedy, and dynamic programming approaches for each variant, providing pseudocode plus detailed time and space complexity analysis for all methods. Using experimental evaluations across varying input sizes, the study shows that brute force guarantees optimal solutions but becomes infeasible due to exponential time growth, especially for larger instances. Greedy algorithms run significantly faster and scale well, but they do not always return optimal solutions, performing best in scenarios where speed is prioritized over exact optimality (e.g., large fractional or bounded instances). Dynamic programming consistently yields optimal or near-optimal solutions for 0/1 and bounded knapsack problems at the cost of higher polynomial time and space usage, while being less suitable for fractional knapsack where the greedy strategy is naturally optimal. Overall, the report concludes that algorithm selection for knapsack problems should be guided by the trade-off between optimality and computational cost: use dynamic programming when exact solutions are critical and the instance size is manageable, and favor greedy approaches for large-scale cases where fast, approximate solutions are acceptable.
